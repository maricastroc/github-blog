## üìö Project Description

In this project, I developed a comprehensive 3-page website that showcases all repositories belonging to a GitHub user, providing detailed information about each repository. The application includes the following features.

- User profile listing with image, number of followers, name and other information available through the GitHub API.
- Listing of all user repositories, with title, description and specification of the predominant language, with search bar for filtering the results
- Provide a list of repository details, including the creation date, percentage of each language used, homepage link, and display the content of the readme file.


## üìå What did I learn?

In this project, I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of passing parameters through application routes. I utilized the axios library to handle API requests and gained experience in applying search filters.

Furthermore, I leveraged the react-markdown and react-syntax-highlighter libraries to convert GitHub readme file of each repository into HTML format and beautifully highlight code syntax within text blocks.
